# pizza-store-manager
Web manager for a pizza store. The repository includes the front-end and the back-end.

The program is in Italian, I hope this is not a problem in usability.
You can also find a report on the program (in Italian) and all its design phase.

Credits to Sami Boutaaba, my friend and school mate, to have collaborated with me in this project.

This program can be used completely free for learning purposes
